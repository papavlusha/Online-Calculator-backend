## Using Swagger UI

Swagger UI provides a visual interface for interacting with application's API. It automatically generates documentation based on application code and allows to view and test all available API endpoints.

### Access UI

After launching application, you can access the Swagger UI by going to the following URL: http://localhost:8082/OnlineCalculator/swagger-ui.html

### Using UI

On the Swagger UI page, you will see a list of all available API endpoints. Available to click on any of them to see detailed information including endpoint description, request parameters, sample responses, and more.

To test an API endpoint, click on the "Try it out" button, enter the required parameters, then click "Execute". You will see the results of the request, including the response code, response time, and response body.

### Update documentation

Swagger documentation is automatically updated when your application code changes. If you add a new API endpoint or modify an existing one, these changes will be reflected in the Swagger UI the next time you run your application.
