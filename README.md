# Online-Calculator-backend

## Overview

This is a branch of the server-side software of the application under development.

## Using Swagger UI

Swagger UI provides a visual interface for interacting with your application's API. It automatically generates documentation based on your application code and allows you to view and test all available API endpoints.

### Access the Swagger UI

After launching your application, you can access the Swagger UI by going to the following URL: http://localhost:8082/OnlineCalculator/swagger-ui.html

### Using Swagger UI

On the Swagger UI page, you will see a list of all available API endpoints. You can click on any of them to see detailed information including endpoint description, request parameters, sample responses, and more.

To test an API endpoint, click on the "Try it out" button, enter the required parameters, then click "Execute". You will see the results of the request, including the response code, response time, and response body.

### Update Swagger documentation

Swagger documentation is automatically updated when your application code changes. If you add a new API endpoint or modify an existing one, these changes will be reflected in the Swagger UI the next time you run your application.
